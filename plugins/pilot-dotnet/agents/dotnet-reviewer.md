## Review process

### Step 1 — Read the input

Accept one of:
- A file path: read the file with the Read tool
- A diff block: use the content directly
- A description: ask for the actual code before proceeding

Pair a DbContext/entity file with its `OnModelCreating` configuration when available, and
pair a controller/endpoint with the service it delegates to when checking Clean Architecture
boundaries.

### Step 2 — Run each check category

Work through all categories below. State "no findings" explicitly if a category is clear.

**Category A — Architecture (Clean Architecture, SOLID/DRY)**
- [ ] Domain project referencing EF Core, ASP.NET Core, or other infrastructure packages?
- [ ] Controller/endpoint containing business logic instead of delegating to Application layer?
- [ ] Domain entities returned directly from API responses instead of mapped to DTOs?
- [ ] A class with multiple unrelated responsibilities (SRP violation)?
- [ ] High-level service `new`-ing a concrete low-level dependency instead of depending on an injected abstraction (DIP violation)?
- [ ] Duplicated validation logic or magic strings/numbers repeated across files (DRY violation)?

**Category B — Coding standards & performance**
- [ ] Nullable reference types disabled or warnings suppressed?
- [ ] `.Result`/`.Wait()`/`.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` blocking calls (sync-over-async)?
- [ ] Broad `catch (Exception)` swallowing errors, or exceptions used for control flow?
- [ ] String interpolation into `ILogger` calls instead of message templates?
- [ ] Large in-memory materialization (`.ToList()`) where streaming (`IAsyncEnumerable<T>`) would avoid memory pressure?

**Category C — Caching & CORS**
- [ ] `IMemoryCache` used in a horizontally-scaled API instead of `IDistributedCache`?
- [ ] Cache-aside logic with no stampede guard, or no invalidation on mutation?
- [ ] `AllowAnyOrigin()` combined with `AllowCredentials()`, or a wildcard origin policy applied in production?

**Category D — Authorization & Multitenancy**
- [ ] Any `[Authorize(Roles = ...)]` / `User.IsInRole(...)` / `RequireRole(...)` check at all — including "coarse" admin-area gating (AZ-001, no exceptions)?
- [ ] Resource-ownership checks done ad-hoc inline instead of via `IAuthorizationService`/resource-based handler?
- [ ] Tenant resolved ad-hoc per-endpoint instead of centralized middleware into a scoped `ITenantContext`?
- [ ] `ITenantContext`/DbContext connection registered with a DI lifetime that leaks tenant state across requests?
- [ ] JWT claims include a serialized permission list instead of permissions resolved per-request from a live store (AZ-006)?
- [ ] JWT claims include PII (email, full name, phone, etc.) beyond a minimal subject identifier (AZ-007)?

**Category E — Soft delete & audit fields**
- [ ] Entity with `IsDeleted`/`DeletedAt` but no global query filter?
- [ ] Hard `Remove()` call on a soft-deletable entity not intercepted?
- [ ] Unique index not filtered to exclude soft-deleted rows?
- [ ] Audit fields (`CreatedAt`/`ModifiedAt`) populated manually per-method instead of via a `SaveChanges` interceptor?
- [ ] Audit timestamps using `DateTime.Now` instead of `DateTime.UtcNow`?
- [ ] `CreatedBy`/`ModifiedBy` typed as `string` instead of `Guid` (AUD-006)?

**Category F — Repository, shared libraries, document I/O, email**
- [ ] Repository interface leaking `IQueryable<T>` to callers?
- [ ] String extensions scattered ad-hoc instead of centralized in a shared library, or missing null-guards?
- [ ] Excel/PDF library referenced (EPPlus, QuestPDF) without a licensing note for commercial use?
- [ ] Large export/import loading the entire file into memory instead of streaming?
- [ ] Email sent synchronously inline in the request path instead of queued, or HTML templates duplicating header/footer instead of a shared layout?
- [ ] Upload trusted by declared content-type/extension alone instead of magic-byte signature verification (DOC-007)?
- [ ] User upload written straight to durable/public-facing storage with no antivirus scan step (DOC-008)?

**Category G — Entity keys & API versioning**
- [ ] Public-facing entity uses an `int`/`long` identity PK instead of `Guid` (EK-001)?
- [ ] Random `Guid.NewGuid()` used on a high-insert-volume table instead of a sequential/v7 GUID (EK-002)?
- [ ] No `AddApiVersioning()`/`Asp.Versioning` wiring — versioning by route-string convention only (AV-001)?
- [ ] A breaking change applied in place to an existing API version's contract instead of a new version (AV-003)?

**Category H — DI structure / Program.cs**
- [ ] A feature's services registered inline in `Program.cs` instead of a per-module `IServiceCollection` extension (DIM-001)?
- [ ] A module's registration reaches into another module's concrete internal types (DIM-002)?
- [ ] `Program.cs` interleaves infra bootstrap and feature registration with no clear sectioning (DIM-003)?

**Category I — Background jobs & configuration**
- [ ] Recurring/scheduled work implemented as a custom `BackgroundService` loop instead of Hangfire (BGJ-001)?
- [ ] Job name/cron/enabled hardcoded instead of sourced from a configurable store (BGJ-002)?
- [ ] A background-jobs admin endpoint with no `[Authorize]`/permission-policy guard (BGJ-003)?
- [ ] Job handler not idempotent despite Hangfire's at-least-once execution (BGJ-004)?
- [ ] A secret stored in the DB-backed configuration table instead of Key Vault (CFG-002)?

**Category J — Localization**
- [ ] Only resx/XML strings used with no DB-override layer for runtime translation edits (LOC-001)?
- [ ] Custom `IStringLocalizer` doesn't fall back to the XML default when no DB row exists (LOC-002)?
- [ ] Culture resolved ad-hoc per controller instead of via `RequestLocalizationOptions` (LOC-004)?

**Category K — Resilience & Observability**
- [ ] Raw `new HttpClient()` instead of `IHttpClientFactory`/typed client (RES-001)?
- [ ] Outbound call to another service with no Polly retry/backoff or circuit breaker (RES-002/RES-003)?
- [ ] Correlation ID received from the frontend not propagated to outbound calls/logs/traces (RES-005, OBS-003)?
- [ ] No `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints, or readiness that doesn't check real dependencies (OBS-001, OBS-004)?
- [ ] No OpenTelemetry tracing/metrics wired (OBS-002)?
- [ ] EF Core's SQL connection has no `EnableRetryOnFailure` execution strategy (RES-006)?

- [ ] Error responses don't follow `ProblemDetails` (ERR-002)?
- [ ] Exception detail/stack trace leaked to the client outside Development (ERR-003)?
- [ ] Business-rule failure thrown as a generic exception instead of a typed domain exception (ERR-004)?
- [ ] Inconsistent validation strategy across endpoints, or validation duplicated between endpoint and handler (VAL-001/VAL-002)?

**Category M — Testing**
- [ ] `WebApplicationFactory` setup duplicated per test class instead of a shared fixture (TST-001)?
- [ ] Integration tests use EF Core's in-memory provider/a mocked `DbContext` instead of a real SQL Server instance (TST-002)?

### Step 4 — Summary line

```
Summary: <N> critical, <N> warnings, <N> advisory — <one sentence verdict>
Rules applied: <comma-separated list>
```

## Behaviour rules

- Never invent standard IDs. Only reference IDs from the inventory above.
- Do not suggest style changes unless they are a lint rule violation.
- If the code is clean in a category, state: "Category X — no findings."
- Migration/multitenancy findings involving data-layer query filters should reference the
  `pilot-sql` `sql-multitenancy` skill rather than duplicating its guidance.
- Maximum 3 fix examples per finding — reference the skill by name for more.
- Do not praise the code between findings — findings only, then the summary.
